# Programming Principles Exercises 🐍✨

A collection of Python exercises from my Epicode journey!  
"Because learning to code should be fun 🎯 and occasionally confusing 🤯"

## What's Inside? 🧐

- 🧮 Calculator apps that do... questionable math
- 📅 Date utilities that may or may not account for leap years
- 🛒 A grocery list manager for your existential crises
- ♾️ Infinite loops (use at your own risk ⚠️)
- And other experiments that seemed like a good idea at 2 AM ☕

## Featured Exercises 🌟

- `age_calculator.py` - Guess your age in dog years 🐕
- `grocery_list_exercise.py` - For when milk = eggs = bread = true 🥛
- `infinite_loops.py` - The code equivalent of "Are we there yet?" 🔁
- `bitwise.py` - For people who think binary is a lifestyle 💻

## How to Use 🚀

```bash
# Clone this repository (if it ever leaves your machine)
git clone https://github.com/FrancescoLavelli/Programming-Principles.git

# Run any exercise:
python filename.py

# Contribute your own:
echo "print('Hello World 🌍')" > new_exercise.py
```

## Disclaimer ⚠️

These exercises may contain:

- Excessive use of emojis
- Questionable variable names
- More comments than actual code
- The occasional existential crisis

Use with coffee ☕ and patience 🧘

Made with 💻 and a sprinkle of chaos during Epicode's Programming Principles course!
